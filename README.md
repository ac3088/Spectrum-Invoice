A small web app to make the process of invoicing for a certain customer at work a bit easier.

## To-Do List:

- ~~Refactor (because the code is kinda ugly lol)~~
- Error handling & input validation
- Saving and loading templates for page numbers
- Print the table on the left containing all the orders
- Save the orders table as a file (maybe csv?)
- Be able to sort the table based on table headers (e.g. grade, subject, etc)
